# Unsupervied Domain Adaptation Project using DeepCORAL for Object Recognition

In this project, we will build, train and evaluate a deep learning framework on a standard setting of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). Unsupervised Domain Adaptation is a learning framework to transfer knowledge learned from source domains with a large number of annotated training examples to target domains with unlabeled data only. In particular, for this project we will be using a UDA benchmark consisting of two datasets from Adaptiope which is a domain adaptation dataset with 123 classes in the three domains synthetic, product and real life. We'll be using 20 classes from both Product and Real Life datasets. Each one will play the role of the source and the target then we will conduct the same experiment in the other direction. As for the Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Technique, we'll be using a Discrepancy-based Method called DeepCORAL (Research Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.01719.pdf )
